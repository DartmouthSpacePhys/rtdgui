We need:

*branch rtdgui_singlechan

*A display name unique to each channel
-->DISP_NAME

*Single-channel display, not dual
-->remove everything having to do with second window

*Unique plot boundaries for each channel
MAXFREQ
MINFREQ (defaults to 0Hz)

*Removal of three unnecessary FFTs in lower window
